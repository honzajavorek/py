# py

This is [@honzajavorek](https://github.com/honzajavorek/)'s experimental playground for the next generation of the [python.cz](https://github.com/pyvec/python.cz/) website.

## Fundamental changes

- The [honzajavorek/py](https://github.com/honzajavorek/py) repository is not a direct fork of [pyvec/python.cz](https://github.com/pyvec/python.cz/). It has a common git commit history with it, but several large directories have been nuked:
    - `talks`
    - `files`
    - `identity`
    - `pythoncz/static/talks`
    - `pythoncz/static/photos`
- If anything good comes out of the development, [@honzajavorek](https://github.com/honzajavorek/) will donate the code to the [@pyvec](https://github.com/pyvec/) organization and we can have community talks on whether we want to switch the source for the python.cz domain. As this isn't a fork, there will never be a Pull Request back to [pyvec/python.cz](https://github.com/pyvec/python.cz/).
